<<show a picture with dots arranged in a circle, show some noisy points, show the outcome when a little bit of noise is added>>

<<you will need some diagrams to explain how the algo works, show 3 points, fit a circle, how many outliers>>

# Formal definition of the RANSAC algorithm
<<write the algo in a formal language, wee Wikipedia >>
