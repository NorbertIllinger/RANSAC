# Introduction
In this article we will explore the Random Sample Consensus algorithm - more popularly known by the acronym RANSAC. This is an iterative and a non-deterministic algorithm that helps in eliminating outliers. This algorithm is commonly used in the sphere of computer vision. I have written a sample implementation using Python

# Problem definition
Consider the following diagram. The human mind can immediately spot that there is one straight line and the mind has no difficulty in distinguising the inliers from the outliers. How can me make the computer emulate this aspect of the human behavior? The RANSAC algorithm attempts to address this challenge.

<<Show a picture of points along a straight line, with some noisy points - The human mind is able to identify the outliers - how do we make the computer achieve this>>

# Traditional approach - Fitting a straight line 
<<Show a picture, points and a line passing - no noise>>
Consider the points above. How do we find a line which fits this distribution?
